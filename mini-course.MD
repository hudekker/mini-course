  - HTML stands for "Hyper-Text Markup Language" but everyone just says HTML
- CSS is the styling of the web page
  - Colors
  - Spacing
  - Size
  - Dynamically scale for small to large screens
  - CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheet" but everyone says CSS
- Javascript (JS) is the action of the web page
  - Button clicks create an event which can trigger a javascript function
  - Keyboard clicks are also events which can trigger a response
  - A page initial startup is also an event which can trigger a function
  - Functions are sections of code that receive a parameters as an input and can generate an output
  - When speaking we say "Javascript" but when writing we often abbreviate it "JS"

## CSS

- Style of the web page by HTML tags, ids, or classes
- Most of the styling is done by classes
- Each line of the HTML can have an ID and a Class
- Classes can be used many times on a web page but IDs are unique

## Javascript
